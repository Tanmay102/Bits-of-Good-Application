                    <p id="introduction"> Hi there! I'm Tanmay, a sophomore from McKinney, TX. I'm deeply passionate about leveraging 
                        technology for societal good. Through initiatives like virtual tutoring for underprivileged children through a non-profit, 
                        and the NHS volunteer hour tracker I built, I have seen the transformative impact technology can have on 
                        empowering people and communities. Thus, I am committed to creating digital solutions to make a meaningful difference.
                        In my free time, I enjoy building robots, getting dessert with friends and family, and watching shows.

                            <h2>Badminton</h2>
                            <p>I'm an avid badminton player, having played competitively for the last 5 years.
                                At my peak, I was among the top 40 players in the nation, and I continue to play 
                                on the competitive team for GT Badminton Club, where we recently won the Southern Conference Regional Badminton Tournament.</p>

                            <h2>Guitar</h2>
                            <p>I also absolutely love playing the guitar. A self-taught guitarist, 
                                playing the guitar is the perfect way for me to unwind after a long day. I like to say the guitar is my own form of meditation,
                                as the melody transports me to a world of my own, free of all troubles and perfectly at peace.
