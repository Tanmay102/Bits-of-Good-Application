                            <h2>Badminton</h2>
                            <p>I'm an avid badminton player, having played competitively for the last 5 years.
                                At my peak, I was among the top 40 players in the nation, and I continue to play 
                                on the competitive team for GT Badminton Club, where we recently won the Southern Conference Regional Badminton Tournament.</p>

                            <h2>Guitar</h2>
                            <p>I also absolutely love playing the guitar. A self-taught guitarist, 
                                playing the guitar is the perfect way for me to unwind after a long day. I like to say the guitar is my own form of meditation,
                                as the melody transports me to a world of my own, free of all troubles and perfectly at peace.
